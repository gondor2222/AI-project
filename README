AI Project: Simulated Annealing for multitarget synthesis

###########README###########
Use of this program requires no special knowledge and requires only a few steps.
1: Compile all source files with "javac *.java"
2: Run the main file with "java Synthesis <n> <r> <s> <t1> <t2> <t3> ... <tx>",
   where n is the desired number of compounds in the graph
         r is the desired number of reactions in the graph
         s is the desired seed for the random number generator
         t1, t2, t3... tx are the indices of the desired target compounds (indexed from 0)
3: The program outputs first a list of compounds and reactions in the graph with their dependencies
   The program then outputs the initial generated plan, which is all compounds and reactions within
      a certain depth of the target compounds depending on the number of total compounds
   Finally, the program runs the annealing and outputs the final annealed plan, or notifies the user if the initial plan was not viable

Substrates are generated randomly and make up 30% of all compounds in the database. If any of the targets are substrates, the program terminates
   and asks the user to pick a different compound.


Example: $ java Synthesis 10 100 203572 0 3 5
Note that if r is not much larger than c (at least 5 times larger), the problem is unlikely to be solvable.
